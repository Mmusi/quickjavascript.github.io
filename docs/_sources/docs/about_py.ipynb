    "## What\\'s JavaScript?\n",
    "\n",
    "[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) is a text-based programming language used on both the client-side and server-side.This allows programmers to make web pages interactive.\n",
    "Whereas HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript is what gives web pages the ability to engage with a user. The language conceived in 1995 by  programmer [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich).\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is free and open source, with development coordinated through the\n",
    "[OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript has experienced rapid adoption in the last decade and is now one\n",
    "of the most commonly used programming languages with about .\n",

    "### Common Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is a general-purpose language but has a s of recently been used as a scripting language used in:\n",
    "such as\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Web development\n",
    "-   Web servers\n",
    "-   Mobile applications\n",
    "-   Games development\n",
    "-   Presentations and slideshows etc.\n",

    "### Relative Popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "The following chart, produced using Stack Overflow Trends, shows one\n",
    "measure of the relative popularity of JavaScript\n",

    "\n",
    "The figure indicates not only that JavaScript is most popular language but that it is widely used by professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the past 8 years straight JavaScript has unfailingly been the most c ommonly used programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it\\'s clear that\n",
    "\n",
    "-   JavaScript is [not only one of the most popular programming languages worldwide, but it is consistently in one of the Top5 high level languages.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2021).\n",
    "-   JavaScript is one of the language of choice for professionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is a [high-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)\n",
    "suitable for many development jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a multi-paradigm language it allows for different programming styles(event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is interpreted rather than compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice feature of JavaScript is its prevalent uses of modules. In JavaScript they are the most prevalently used design patterns for keeping particular pieces of code independent of other components.\n",
    "This provides loose coupling to support well-structured code. This is good news for those that are familiar with object-oriented languages. Simply modules are JavaScript “classes”.\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). \n",
    "Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. Numbers are not allowed as the first character. \n",
    "This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Web Development \n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is popular for development of web applications..\n",
