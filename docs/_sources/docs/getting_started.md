# Setting up Your JavaScript Environment

## Overview

In this part, you will learn how to

1.  Get a JavaScript environment up and running
2.  execute simple JavScript commands
3.  run a sample program


## Setting up Notepad++ 

To get started with JavaScript all you need is a simple text-editor and a browser. 
Those using windows, can use the default notepad under accessories. I prefer using notepad++ 
that can be downloaded at the following: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.1.5/.

Choose the latest release and click to download. You should get the following screenshot:

```

Based on your computer specifications, download the version that best fits your system.
I downloaded a 64 bits portable as follows: 

You should be able to get a download notification as in the bottom left corners as indicated on the screenshot:

```

The downloaded file can then be copied to anywhere on the computer and  the files extracted. 
I prefer extracting mine in the C:\ file root as follows:

```

As seen above the npp.8.1.4 portable has been extracted on the same location.
Next I open the extracted file and copy the notepad ++ icon to create a shortcut on the desktop:

### Installing Notepad++

```{note}
You can also install notepad via an execution file also  downloaded at , [notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.1.5/)
```

On the desktop you then right click and paste the notepad++ shortcut icon as follows.

Next, every time you wish to use notepad++ , you click on the the icon and should get the following screen :

TIP: Linux and Mac users have similar editors that can be downloaded. 

Important points:

-   Install the latest version!
-   If you are asked during the installation process whether you\'d like
    to make Anaconda your default Python installation, say yes.
	
	 


### Run your first program



```{note}
All of what follows assumes that you adopted the above steps and will be using notepad++,
but using any other text editor should not off er much of a problem.!
