# Introduction

JavaScript is a fully interpreted language with a C like syntax;though some people have always been sceptical of the language as nothing more than a browser scripting language. 
Infact it supports many advanced concepts such as object-oriented-programming, recursion and lambda. 

It has over the years developed to become a very flexible and reasonably understandable language for the beginner that quickly scales to become as powerful a tool as the users’ skills necessitates.
It is my intention that this tutorial acts as a reference that will cover basic language constructs, though this will not necessarily be a beginner’s guide to programming. 
I will focus on scaling up those with intermediate’s skills and knowledge from other programming languages to quickly grasp JavaScript methodology. 
This however will not constitute an exhaustive language definition, but rather a broad overview that will occasionally focus on some advanced concepts. 
I am here to get you started. Further referral to other books and literature will help you focus and scale up to becoming an expert.
