# Introduction

JavaScript is a fully interpreted language with a C like syntax;though some people have always been sceptical of the language as nothing more than a browser scripting language. 
Infact it supports many advanced concepts such as object-oriented-programming, recursion and lambda. 


### Brief History
In the old days higher-end programmers used "Java" which was regarded as a “component language.”
The creator of JavaScript identified a need for a “glue language”. This “glue language” would put together components 
and automate interactions in the web. Over time JavaScript has built on this to enable developers to build increased interaction 
and complexity into their applications, ensuring that it is possible that we live in a world of search engines,responsive design,
ecommerce,social media and content management systems as we know it today.

It has over the years developed to become a very flexible and reasonably understandable language for the beginner to quickly grasp
and professionals to comfortably master the web as we all know the web runs on JavaScript.

It is my intention that this tutorial acts as a reference that will cover basic language constructs, though this will not necessarily be a beginner’s guide to programming. 
I will focus on scaling up those with intermediate’s skills and knowledge from other programming languages to quickly grasp JavaScript methodology. 
This however will not constitute an exhaustive language definition, but rather a broad overview that will occasionally focus on some advanced concepts. 

I am here to get you started. Further referral to other books and literature will help you focus and scale up to becoming an expert.


:::{tip}
 JavaScript is a very powerful language that easily scales to become as powerful a tool as the users’ skills necessitates.
